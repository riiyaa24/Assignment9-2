 Assignment9-2

 Create angular application which creates two custom pipes named as MyAdd & MyMult. MyAdd pipe is used to add two numbers and MyMult is used to multiply two numbers.

 Example :

{{8 | MyAdd : 3}} Output should be 11
{{7 | MyMult : 3}} Output should be 21

For this purpose we have to create two separate pipes and inside transform method of each pipe we have to write logic of addition and multiplication respectively.
